Before we start, it's important to  know the difference between data and information. Data is basically anything you can perceive. But it's not information until you can use itâ€”until it's useful. 

For example, a list of a stock's prices is simply data until you notice a trend that tells you to buy or sell; that trend in the stock prices is information.  In video games, a boss's movements are data until you notice a pattern that tells you how to dodge or strike; that "tell" is information.

Simply put, data is potential information. And information is useful data. 

Something needs to transform the data into information, and that something is a computer program.

A computer program is a sequence of instructions that transforms data into information. A computer program can also store data, e.g., into a database, or forward the data, e.g., across a network. 

But the prime directive, the sine qua non, the essential function of a computer program is to transform data into information.

But where do you the computer program? The answer is: from a computer programmer. 

Programming is the activity by computer programmers, which results in a sequence of instructions that a computer can use to transform data into information.


```{r}

# Open a csv file into a data frame
df=read.csv("HPQ.csv") # df is a VARIABLE, read.csv is a FUNCTION, "hp.csv" is a PARAMETER

# Display
df
```
```{r}
plot(df$Open, type="o")
text(1:length(df$Open))
sum(df$Open)
```
```{r}
plot(df$Close)
```
```{r}
barplot(df$Close)
```
You can also read a file directly from a URL

```{r}
DataFrame=read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv")
DataFrame
```
